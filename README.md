2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it?<br>

      For the most part, the directions were pretty clear on how to get this project done. I did, however, encountered an issue while trying to implement the
      3 strikes for the player. When I first tried to implement it, the user would get 3 chances to put the entire sequence before losing the game. 
      I overcame this issue by thoroughly going over the `guess()` method. I realized that I put the check for the strikes in the wrong place, and put it
      in the correct one. The issue was then solved, and the player could only get 3 guesses before losing the game.  <br> 
      
      Another issue I had was implementing the randomly generated pattern in the beginning of the game. I knew how to create the array of randomly generated numbers, 
      but I didn't know for sure if the method was working. It turns out that I just need to do a simple *Inspect Element* to see what the array was being printed out as. I am not 
      accustomed to using glitch, and I thought that my console log statements would appear on the screen ðŸ˜…  . 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission?

    
    One question that I have about web development is: how similar is the work of a Software Engineer at a tech company to that of what we just completed for this assignment? In other words, how often do
    web developers get to work with the basics as opposed to working with more advanced topics? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

    If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would definitely try to recreate it using React. I think using React could help this program become more modern and interactive. I can 
    already imagine the buttons as components, and handling the events based on user input. <br>
    
    I would also make the game more customizable. For example, I could ask the user to input the length of the sequence for the pattern, and also have them pick a difficulty levelâ€” where the time to put the correct note is shorter with the more difficult levels. 

   Another thing I could possibly do is to allow two people to play. In this case, the first person would play a note, and the second person would have to copy the note and then add one more note. The sequence of notes would get longer and longer with each turn, and the first person to put the incorrect note would lose.
